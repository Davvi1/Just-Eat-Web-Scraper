This is a web scraping tool, cleaner, and visualizer built in my summer course
in social data science.
My group of three collected data from the cities of Denmark in terms of...

                (yes, we had some fun)

... Pizza prices of dozens of local pizzerias!

We did this to find out and visualize where in Denmark we could get the
absolute cheapest pizza, and glean metadata on different types of pizza
vis-a-vis their demographics. In doing this, we scraped Just Eat and Wikipedia,
and got additional geographic data and a few other points here and there from
other sources.
We then handed in a report for this, and got the highest possible grade
for our code and report, the latter of which where we communicated our findings
and process.
